This is a port of Rover's Day Out -- an interactive fiction game
written in Inform 7 -- to a native iOS app.

99% of the work was done by Andrew Plotkin, who created the entire
app framework (glulxe and glk port) to iOS; see his 'iosglulxe'
project.  This project is a deliberate fork of that project, exactly
as he intended folks to do.
